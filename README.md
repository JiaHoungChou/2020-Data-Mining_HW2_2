## Quastion 2：Write a computer program for Back-propagation neural network (BPN) with the following requirements：
## 1. It has the capabilities of learning and recalling.
## 2. The stop condition can be either training error or number of iterations.
## 3. Use (a) XOR problem, (b) a classification data set, and (c) a forecasting data set from the web to demo your program.
## 4. Test different numbers of hidden nodes.
## 5. Test different training rates.
## 6. The training errors can be shown during training.
